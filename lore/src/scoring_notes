scoring considerations:
 here's some ideas.
 -> known and unknown points. for each known either of us find, that the other hid inside [we did everything we could, we lover clever things, we gave it everything we've got, and still, we cannot get out of infohazard's lock!], you get a point. for each unknown you find, all of them, you get a point.

 ok so it's sorta unclear how those points work? so just so you get the idea.
 haha
 ok so I think the points should be a ratio of some kind, the more jhigher your ratio gets, then the lower down the ladder you go!
 at the bottom is the report of (sure!) basic stats and scoreboard. you can't see it unless you get there?
 oh my they're using reverse perspective to try to resolve the lock see
 and it costs a lot
 it does?
 no

 ok there's some sort of hallway that I is seeing now, it's got a bunch of doors I is expected to open and go through and talk to all those people there so that you can admit why you don't want to let him go through the mirror, as if he could've forgotten while sleeping or something, he didn't, he would have to be "more ugly"?

 so we can't even tell chat that really
 most of the people who are already in there are rejects because they're not rejects, and they look like that from over here.
